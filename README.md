# antizer

Antizer is a ClojureScript library implementing [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) React components for [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) and [Rum](https://github.com/tonsky/rum).

Ant Design is an enterprise-class UI design language and React-based implementation with the following features:

* An enterprise-class UI design language for web applications.
* A set of high-quality React components out of the box.
* Extensive API documentation and examples.

### Who's Using Antizer

* [History Master](https://github.com/jiacai2050/history-master)

## Usage

To use Antizer, add the following to your project.clj:

```clojure
[antizer "0.4.0"]
```

You would also need to add the ClojureScript React library that you will be using.

For Reagent:
```clojure
[reagent "X.Y.Z"]
```

For Rum:
```clojure
[rum "X.Y.Z"]
```

It is also necessary to include the relevant Ant Design CSS stylesheet in your HTML page. There are two ways that the CSS files can be included:

1. Loading the CSS stylesheet from an external CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/antd/${antd_version}/antd.min.css">
```

where `${antd_version}` must be the same antd library version as the one that Antizer is being linked to.

2. Alternatively, the CSS sheetsheet can be loaded from either of the following classpaths. This can be done via [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) library's [wrap-resource](https://ring-clojure.github.io/ring/ring.middleware.resource.html) function:

* `cljsjs/antd/development/antd.inc.css`
* `cljsjs/antd/production/antd.min.inc.css`

An example of how this can be done is provided by https://github.com/dfuenzalida/antizer-demo.

You can also follow the instructions for customization with LESS [here](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme).

### Quick Example

For Reagent:
```clojure
(require '[antizer.reagent :as ant])
(require '[reagent.core :as r])

(defn click-me []
  [ant/button {:on-click #(ant/message-info "Hello Reagent!")} "Click me"])

(defn init! []
  (r/render [click-me] (.-body js/document)))
```

For Rum:
```clojure
(require '[antizer.rum :as ant])
(require '[rum.core :as rum])

(defn click-me []
  (ant/button {:on-click #(ant/message-info "Hello Rum!")} "Click me"))

(defn init! []
  (rum/mount (click-me) (.-body js/document)))
```

## Examples

To compile the examples:

```bash
lein with-profile +examples cljsbuild once
```

To compile the examples and enable hot reloading with figwheel:

```bash
lein with-profile +examples-dev figwheel
```

After compilation, open up the respective HTML page in the `examples/resources` folder in your browser.
